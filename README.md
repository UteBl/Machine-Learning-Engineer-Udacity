# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program
The MLNP was about learning the Data Science and Machine Learning Skills to build Machine Learning Models and to work as a successful ML Engineer. I participated in the program from 2019 - 2020 alongside my regular job as a data scientist. 

The program consisted of two parts, each to be completed in five months with a weekly duration of 10 hours. But as it soon turned out, it could also be more. Nevertheless, it was a very valuable experience for me, as I was able to apply and implement a lot of what I had learned in practice. In detail, the schedule looked like this:

## Part I Machine Learning Foundations
The Program began by exploring core machine learning concepts, before moving on to supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices (Regression)
- Project 2: Finding Donors for CharityML (Classification)
- Project 3: Creating Customer Segments (Clustering)

## Part II Advanced Machine Learning
In this term, we covered topics in deep learning and reinforcement learning. The term culminated with a capstone project of my choosing, that applies the machine learning techniques and algorithms I have learned.
- Project 4: Dog Breed Classifier (CNNs)
- Project 5: Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly (Reinforcement Learning)
- Capstone Project: Determine the price of used cars
